# ND CAFMaker
`ND_CAFMaker` takes input `edep-sim`, `GENIE`, and reconstructed objects from the DUNE ND and combines them into the Common Analysis Format ("CAF").

# Setup
The package has a number of dependencies, all accessible through the `ups` framework at Fermilab and github. 
The first time you use it'll you'll need to build the dependencies.  Simply run
```
./build.sh
```

For subsequent use, 
```
source ndcaf_setup.sh
```
is sufficient to set up your environment for the common use cases.
**If, however, you need to set up a local version of `duneanaobj` for testing purposes, you must edit `ndcaf_setup.sh` before sourcing it.**

## Inputs
The package is controlled by `fhicl` config files, found in the `cfg` directory. The `cfg/ndcafmakerjob.fcl` shows the basic setup.

For the minimal test setup:
* Provide an `InputGHEPFile`, which contains the GENIE truth information in `GHEP` format
* Provide an `OutputFile`, where your file will be saved

Extending upon the minimal test setup you can:
* Provide a `NDLArRecoFile`, which contains the output of the ND LAr reconstruction
* Provide a `TMSRecoFile`, which contains the output of the TMS reconstruction
* Provide a `SANDRecoFile`, which contains the output of the SAND reconstruction

To add variables and inspect what is set and how, check `src/Params.h`.


## Building
Once you've set up your environment, it's just a matter of typing 
```
make
```
in the `ND_CAFMaker` folder, which goes through and builds the objects, library and single `makeCAF` executable.

# Running
There is currently only one main executable, `makeCAF`, which is controlled entirely by the input `fhicl` file. To run with the `fhicl` file that was specified under `Inputs`, do
```
./makeCAF --fcl=path_to_your_fhicl_file.fcl
```

You can also override some of the `fhicl` inputs, which are specified by typing 
```
./makeCAF --help
```
and should output
```
Usage: ./makeCAF [options] <driver.fcl> [options]

General options:
  -h [ --help ]          print this help message

FCL overrides (for quick tests; edit your .fcl for regular usage):
  -g [ --ghep ] arg      input GENIE .ghep file
  -o [ --out ] arg       output CAF file
  --startevt arg         event number to start at
  -n [ --numevts ] arg   total number of events to process (-1 means 'all')
```

# Output tree and event format

The output contains a number of different `TTree` `ROOT` objects. `cafTree` contains the information from the reconstruction and some truth information from the `edep-sim` detector simulation, and `genieEvt` contains the true `GENIE` information from the neutrino interaction simulation.

The object format for the `StandardRecord` objects is defined in [`duneanaobj`](https://github.com/DUNE/duneanaobj).
See the README there for instructions on how to set it up and modify it.

## Using a locally installed `duneanaobj` for testing

`duneanaobj`'s [README](https://github.com/DUNE/duneanaobj/blob/master/README.md) explains how to construct a custom UPS product that can be used in place of the version used by default by `ndcaf_setup.sh`.
If you have such a custom version that you wish to use, edit `ndcaf_setup.sh` to add your custom UPS directory to `$PRODUCTS` and to set up the version name for your working copy.
Consult the README for more details.
